In productive environments applications and services need to meet these requirements:

- Fault-tolerance
- On-demand scalability
- Optimal resource utilization
- Auto-discovery for communication with each other
- Accessibility from the outside world
- Seamless updates/rollbacks without downtime

This is where Container orchestrators such as Kubernetes come in. The main functionality includes, but is not limited to:

- Grouping hosts together to form clusters
- Scheduling containers to run on hosts
- Enabling communication between containers in the cluster regardless of host
- Binding containers and storage resources
- Simplifying access through a level of abstraction between container and client
- Manage and optimize resource usage
- Allow for implementation of policies to secure access to applications
